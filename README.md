# Multiple-disease-prediction-using-ML 
## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict multiple diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease based on patient health parameters.
By utilizing different classification algorithms, the system provides early disease prediction which can help in preventive healthcare and better decision-making.

## ✨ Features
-Predicts multiple diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease.

-User-friendly interface ( Streamlit web app).

-Data preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw datasets for better accuracy.

-Model comparison: Uses multiple ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.

-High accuracy with optimized hyperparameters.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
-Python 3.x

-Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, joblib

-Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

-Web App: Streamlit
